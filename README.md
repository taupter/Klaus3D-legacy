# Klaus3D-legacy
Ancient experimental code for 3D model visualization

This code was made in early 90's, migrated from an even older late 80's Pascal source code that ran on MSX-DOSv(8-bit), later migrated to Borland C on MS-DOS.
This repository's purpose is to make an old project of mine be compiled using a modern set of development tools, without any radical change in functionality other than general bug fixing and light missing functionality implementation.
A newer implementation with proper OOP will be developed and released if deemed feasible.
